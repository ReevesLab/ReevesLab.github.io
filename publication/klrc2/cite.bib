    abstract = {Author summary Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial component of the early innate immune response, and although NK cell responses have been thought be only non-specific, recent evidence suggests that NK cells are capable of expanding with some specificity, indicative of a memory-like adaptive response. The activating receptor NKG2C has been one cell surface protein associated with this memory-like NK cell expansion in the context of CMV and HIV infection in humans, yet very little is known about NKG2C+ NK cells in non-human primate (NHP) animal models. This is predominantly because there are no antibodies that can distinguish NKG2C from other NKG2 family molecules in NHP. Because vaccine and cure-related studies for HIV rely heavily on NHP models, this is a significant impediment towards understanding an NK cell population that may possibly improve responses to HIV. In this paper we present a solution, by adapting a technique whereby mRNA specific to NKG2C and NKG2A (KLRC2 and KLRC1, respectively) is fluorescently labeled while the cell is simultaneously stained using traditional flow cytometry, and provide a first-ever characterization of NKG2C+ NK cells in NHP. Further, we show that NKG2C+ NK cells expand in a memory-like fashion following rhCMV and SIV infections.},
