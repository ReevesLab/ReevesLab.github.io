abstract = {Abstract The oral mucosae and draining lymph nodes are primary entry points for invading pathogens, particularly during immunosuppressive HIV/SIV infections. Innate immunity against oral stimuli, including natural killer (NK) cells, is understudied. Herein, we demonstrate functional NK cell responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of potential oral pathogens in rhesus macaques.},,
