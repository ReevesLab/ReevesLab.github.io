    abstract = "Summary
    Despite burgeoning evidence demonstrating the adaptive properties of natural killer (NK) cells, mechanistic   
    data explaining these phenomena are lacking. Following antibody sensitization, NK cells lacking the Fc 
    receptor (FcR) signaling chain (Δg) acquire adaptive features, including robust proliferation, multifunctional
    ity, rapid killing, and mobilization to sites of virus exposure. Using the rhesus macaque model, we demonstrat
    e the systemic distribution of Δg NK cells expressing memory features, including downregulated Helios and 
    Eomes. Furthermore, we find that Δg NK cells abandon typical γ-chain/Syk in lieu of CD3ζ-Zap70 signaling. 
    FCγRIIIa (CD16) density, mucosal homing, and function are all coupled to this alternate signaling, which in 
    itself requires priming by rhesus cytomegalovirus (rhCMV). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections 
    further expand gut-homing adaptive NK cells but result in pathogenic suppression of CD3ζ-Zap70 signaling and 
    function. Herein, we provide a mechanism of virus-dependent alternative signaling that may explain the 
    acquisition of adaptive features by primate NK cells and could be targeted for future vaccine or curative 
    therapies."
