      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using cutting edge technologies in flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, and -omics tools we are trying to break down and map the fundamental mechanisms behind HIV/SIV resevoir clearance by NK cells and antigen-specific NK cell memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My labâ€™s research has provided comprehensive characterizations of NK cells in nonhuman primate species and revealed significant heterogeneity among NK cells in tissues outside peripheral blood, including identification of previously unknown subpopulations of NK cells in tissues. Notably, we were the first to characterize IL-17/IL-22-producing NKp44+ mucosa-restricted NK cells in macaque species, and were the first to delineate mechanisms of depletion of these cells during lentivirus infections. We have also recently presented the first evidence of NK cell memory in any primate species.&lt;/p&gt;
