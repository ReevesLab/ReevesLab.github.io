others and we have shown that NK cells exhibit memory-like recall responses against CMV and HIV/SIV infections. Although the mechanism(s) have not been fully delineated, several groups have shown that the activating receptor NKG2C is elevated on NK cells in the context of rhesus CMV (rhCMV) or human CMV (hCMV) infections. CD94, which heterodimerizes with NKG2C is also linked to adaptive NK cell responses. Because non-human primates (NHP) play a crucial role in modeling HIV (SIV) infections, it is crucial to be able to assess and characterize the NKG2 family in NHP. Unfortunately it is not possible to detect CD94 using commercially available antibodies in NHP. Our work, a first for NHP, has focused on developing RNA-flow cytometry using mRNA transcripts as proxies distinguishing NKG2C from NKG2A. We have expanded the application of this technology and here we show the first characterization of CD94 (KLRD1)+ NK cells in NHP using multiparametric RNA-Flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from naïve and matched acutely (n=4) or chronically (n=12) SIV-infected rhesus macaques were analyzed by flow cytometry using commercially available antibodies, determining expression of transcripts for NKG2A, NKG2C and CD94 (KLRC1, KLRC2 and KLRD1 respectively) on NK cells using RNA-flow cytometry. Our data show that KLRC1±KLRC2+KLRD1+ NK cells decrease following chronic, but not acute, infection with SIV. This approach will allow us to investigate the kinetics of infection and NK memory formation, and will further improve our understanding of basic NK cell biology, especially in the context of SIV infection.Importance:Non-human primates play a crucial role in approximating human biology and many diseases that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in other animal models, notably HIV. Current advances in adaptive NK cell research positions us to address fundamental deficiencies in our fight against infection and disease at the earliest moments following infection, or substantially earlier in disease progression. Here we show that we can identify specific NK cell subpopulations that are modulated following chronic, but not acute, SIV infection. The ability to identify these subsets more precisely will inform therapeutic and vaccine strategies targeting an optimized NK cell response.\n","tags":null,"title":"SIV infection modulates CD94 (KLRD1)+ NK cells in rhesus macaques.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lewis","Ackerman","Scarlatti","Moog","Robert-Guroff","Kent","Overbaugh","Keith Reeves","Ferrari","Thyagarajan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"d93f59761b6c618dbcfeeaa3e47a30ba","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/31134085/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/31134085/","section":"publication","summary":"It is now well-accepted that Fc-mediated effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), can contribute to vaccine-elicited protection as well as post-infection control of HIV viremia.

An earlier comparative study of assay protocols showed that while data from different ADCC assay formats were often correlated, they remained distinct in terms of target cells and the epitopes and antigen(s) available for recognition by antibodies, the effector cells, and the readout of cytotoxicity.

Recent studies also suggest nuances in phenotypic and functional characteristics among NK cell subsets may further permit execution of regulatory and adaptive roles. Animal models, particularly non-human primate (NHP) models, are critical for characterizing NK cell biology in disease and under homeostatic conditions. In HIV infection, NK cells mediate multiple antiviral functions via upregulation of activating receptors, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity through antibody Fc-FcR interaction and others. However, HIV infection can also reciprocally modulate NK cells directly or indirectly, leading to impaired/ineffective NK cell responses. In this review, we will describe multiple aspects of NK cell biology in HIV/SIV infections and their association with viral control and disease progression, and how NHP models were critical in detailing each finding. Further, we will discuss the effect of NK cell depletion in SIV-infected NHP and the characteristics of newly described memory NK cells in NHP models and different mouse strains. Overall, we propose that the role of NK cells in controlling viral infections remains incompletely understood and that NHP models are indispensable in order to efficiently address these deficits.\n","tags":null,"title":"Monkeying Around: Using Non-human Primate Models to Study NK Cell Biology in HIV Infections.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Ghofrani","Olivier Lucar","Dugan","Keith Reeves","Stephanie Jost"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"ce4f5b079beaad72afd7da79793200c6","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/31016720/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/31016720/","section":"publication","summary":"Cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells are endowed with the capacity to mediate enhanced effector functions upon cytokine or activating receptor restimulation for several weeks following short-term preactivation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. Promising results from a first-in-human clinical trial highlighted the clinical potential of CIML NK cells as adoptive immunotherapy for patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the mechanisms underlying CIML NK cell differentiation and increased functionality remain incompletely understood. Semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A) is a potent immunomodulator expressed in activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells. In this study, we show that SEMA7A is substantially upregulated on NK cells stimulated with cytokines, and specifically marks activated NK cells with a strong potential to release IFN-γ. In particular, preactivation of NK cells with IL-12+IL-15+IL-18 resulted in greater than tenfold upregulation of SEMA7A and enhanced expression of the ligand for SEMA7A, integrin-β1, on CIML NK cells. Strikingly, preactivation in the presence of antibodies targeting SEMA7A lead to significantly decreased IFN-γ production following restimulation. These results imply a novel mechanism by which cytokine-enhanced SEMA7A/integrin-β1 interaction promotes CIML NK cell differentiation and maintenance of increased functionality. Our data suggest that targeting SEMA7A/integrin-β1 signaling might provide a novel immunotherapeutic approach to potentiate antitumor activity of CIML NK cells.\n","tags":null,"title":"Semaphorin 7A modulates cytokine-induced memory-like responses by human natural killer cells.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cordelia Manickam","Li","Spandan Shah","Kyle Kroll","Keith Reeves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"2ca76e5d0d13ab9d0600ad76baf88055","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/30418531/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/30418531/","section":"publication","summary":"Natural killer (NK) cells are primary immune effector cells with both innate and potentially adaptive functions against viral infections, but commonly become exhausted or dysfunctional during chronic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

However, aberrant or unrestricted cytokine responses can damage host tissues, leading to organ dysfunction, and even death. To understand the cytokine milieu and immune responses in infected host tissues, non-human primate (NHP) models have emerged as important tools. NHP have been used for decades to study human infections and have played significant roles in the development of vaccines, drug therapies and other immune treatment modalities, aided by an ability to control disease parameters, and unrestricted tissue access. In addition to the genetic and physiological similarities with humans, NHP have conserved immunologic properties with over 90% amino acid similarity for most cytokines. For example, human-like symptomology and acute respiratory syndrome is found in cynomolgus macaques infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, antibody enhanced dengue disease is common in neotropical primates, and in NHP models of viral hepatitis cytokine-induced inflammation induces severe liver damage, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma recapitulates human disease. To regulate inflammation, anti-cytokine therapy studies in NHP are underway and will provide important insights for future human interventions. This review will provide a comprehensive outline of the cytokine-mediated exacerbation of disease and tissue damage in NHP models of viral infections and therapeutic strategies that can aid in prevention/treatment of the disease syndromes.\n","tags":null,"title":"Cytokine-Mediated Tissue Injury in Non-human Primate Models of Viral Infections.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mudd","Busman-Sahay","DiNapoli","Lai","Sheik","Lisco","Deleage","Richardson","Palesch","Paiardini","Cameron","Sereti","Keith Reeves","Estes","Brenchley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"28b5bfd4900014bb413df27c666ee2ed","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/30262807/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/30262807/","section":"publication","summary":"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play critical roles in mucosal barrier defense and tissue homeostasis.

So-called NKB cells appear as first responders to infections, but whether this cell population is truly novel or is in fact a subpopulation of B cells and exists in higher primates remains unclear. The objective of this study was to identify NKB cells in primates and study the impact of HIV/SIV infections.\n      DESIGN AND METHODS: NKB cells were quantified in both naive and lentivirus infected rhesus macaques and humans by excluding lineage markers (CD3, CD127) and positive Boolean gating for CD20, NKG2A/C and/or NKp46. Additional phenotypic measures were conducted by RNA-probe and traditional flow cytometry.\n      RESULTS: Circulating cytotoxic NKB cells were found at similar frequencies in humans and rhesus macaques (range, 0.01-0.2% of total lymphocytes). NKB cells were notably enriched in spleen (median, 0.4% of lymphocytes), but were otherwise systemically distributed in tonsil, lymph nodes, colon, and jejunum. Expression of immunoglobulin was highly variable, but heavily favoured IgM and IgA rather than IgG. Interestingly, NKB cell frequencies expanded in PBMC and colon during SIV infection, as did IgG expression, but were generally unaltered in HIV-infected humans.\n      CONCLUSION: These results suggest a cell type expressing both natural killer and B-cell features exists in rhesus macaques and humans and are perturbed by HIV/SIV infection.

We demonstrate increased T-cell activation (HLA-DR+) beginning 3-14 days post-SIV challenge, reduced peripheral zonulin 3-14 days post-SIV, and evidence of microbial translocation 14 days post-SIV. The onset of mucosal dysfunction preceded peripheral and mucosal Th17 depletion, which occurred 14-28 days post-SIV, and gut neutrophil accumulation was not observed. Proteins involved in epithelial structure were downregulated 3 days post-SIV followed by an upregulation of immune proteins 14 days post-SIV.

In addition, NK cells may provide a \"rheostat\" function and have been shown to reduce the magnitude of antigen-specific T cell responses following infection to avoid immunopathology. However, it remains unknown whether NK cells similarly modulate vaccine-elicited T cell responses following virus challenge. We used the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 infection model to address whether NK cells regulate T cell responses in adenovirus vector-vaccinated mice following challenge. As expected, NK cell depletion in unvaccinated mice resulted in increased virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and immunopathology following LCMV challenge. In contrast, NK cell depletion had minimal to no impact on antigen-specific T cell responses in mice that were vaccinated with an adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-GP vector prior to LCMV challenge. Moreover, NK cell depletion in vaccinated mice prior to challenge did not result in immunopathology and did not compromise protective efficacy. These data suggest that adenovirus vaccine-elicited T cells may be less sensitive to NK cell rheostat regulation than T cells primed by LCMV infection.IMPORTANCE Recent data have shown that NK cell depletion leads to enhanced virus-elicited T cell responses that can result in severe immunopathology following LCMV infection in mice.

Collectively, we present a rapid bead-based assay for both humans and macaque models to quantify MMPs that could be an instigator and predictor of immune activation, which is a primary source of HIV/SIV disease.\n","tags":null,"title":"Short Communication: Apoptotic Membrane Microparticles Quantified by Fluorescent Bead-Based Assay Are Elevated in HIV and SIV Infections.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Spandan Shah","Cordelia Manickam","Daniel Ram","Keith Reeves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"913c08789ddb048ab76e8d7558f7861e","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/29326704/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/29326704/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the past several years, new populations of innate lymphocytes have been described in mice and primates that are critical for mucosal homeostasis, microbial regulation, and immune defense. Generally conserved from mice to humans, innate lymphoid cells (ILC) have been divided primarily into three subpopulations based on phenotypic and functional repertoires: ILC1 bear similarities to natural killer cells; ILC2 have overlapping functions with TH2 cells; and ILC3 that share many functions with TH17/TH22 cells. ILC are specifically enriched at mucosal surfaces and are possibly one of the earliest responders during viral infections besides being involved in the homeostasis of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and maintenance of gut epithelial barrier integrity. Burgeoning evidence also suggests that there is an early and sustained abrogation of ILC function and numbers during HIV and pathogenic SIV infections, most notably ILC3 in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to disruption of the mucosal barrier and dysregulation of the local immune system. A better understanding of the direct or indirect mechanisms of loss and dysfunction will be critical to immunotherapeutics aimed at restoring these cells.

Some of the first evidence that NK cells respond in an antigen-specific fashion came from experiments revealing that subpopulations of murine NK cells were able to respond to a specific murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) protein and that in the absence of T and B cells, murine NK cells also mediated adaptive immune responses to a secondary challenge with specific haptens.

Despite this, HLA-C-licensed NK cells displayed reduced antiviral activity compared to their unlicensed counterparts, potentially due to residual binding to the respective inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, NK cells were able to sense alterations of HLA-C expression demonstrated by increased antiviral activity when exposed to viral strains with differential abilities to downmodulate HLA-C.

Here we provide a comprehensive assessment of immune responses that protect against SIV infection through detailed analyses of cellular and humoral immune responses in the blood and tissues of rhesus macaques vaccinated with SIVΔnef and then vaginally challenged with wild-type SIV. Despite the presence of robust cellular immune responses, animals at 5 weeks after vaccination displayed only transient viral suppression of challenge virus, whereas all macaques challenged at weeks 20 and 40 post-SIVΔnef vaccination were protected, as defined by either apparent sterile protection or significant suppression of viremia in infected animals. Multiple parameters of CD8 T cell function temporally correlated with maturation of protection, including polyfunctionality, phenotypic differentiation, and redistribution to gut and lymphoid tissues. Importantly, we also demonstrate the induction of a tissue-resident memory population of SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the vaginal mucosa, which was dependent on ongoing low-level antigenic stimulation. Moreover, we show that vaginal and serum antibody titers inversely correlated with post-challenge peak viral load, and we correlate the accumulation and affinity maturation of the antibody response to the duration of the vaccination period as well as to the SIVΔnef antigenic load. In conclusion, maturation of SIVΔnef-induced CD8 T cell and antibody responses, both propelled by viral persistence in the gut mucosa and secondary lymphoid tissues, results in protective immune responses that are able to interrupt viral transmission at mucosal portals of entry as well as potential sites of viral dissemination.\n","tags":null,"title":"Persistent Low-Level Replication of SIVΔnef Drives Maturation of Antibody and CD8 T Cell Responses to Induce Protective Immunity against Vaginal SIV Infection.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cordelia Manickam","Rajakumar","Wachtman","Kramer","Martinot","Valerie Varner","Giavedoni","Keith Reeves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"3e8aa8b71bb3c1614a0de85b360f3f9c","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/27489267/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/27489267/","section":"publication","summary":"UNLABELLED: Despite its importance in shaping adaptive immune responses, viral clearance, and immune-based inflammation, tissue-specific innate immunity remains poorly characterized for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to the lack of access to acutely infected tissues. In this study, we evaluated the impact of natural killer (NK) cells and myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells on control of virus replication and virus-induced pathology caused by another, more rapidly resolving hepacivirus, GB virus B (GBV-B), in infections of common marmosets. High plasma and liver viral loads and robust hepatitis characterized acute GBV-B infection, and while viremia was generally cleared by 2 to 3 months postinfection, hepatitis and liver fibrosis persisted after clearance. Coinciding with peak viral loads and liver pathology, the levels of NK cells, mDCs, and pDCs in the liver increased up to 3-fold. Although no obvious numerical changes in peripheral innate cells occurred, circulating NK cells exhibited increased perforin and Ki67 expression levels and increased surface expression of CXCR3. These data suggested that increased NK cell arming and proliferation as well as tissue trafficking may be associated with influx into the liver during acute infection. Indeed, NK cell frequencies in the liver positively correlated with plasma (R = 0.698; P = 0.015) and liver (R = 0.567; P = 0.057) viral loads. Finally, soluble factors associated with NK cells and DCs, including gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and RANTES, were increased in acute infection and also were associated with viral loads and hepatitis. Collectively, the findings showed that mobilization of local and circulating innate immune responses was linked to acute virus-induced hepatitis, and potentially to resolution of GBV-B infection, and our results may provide insight into similar mechanisms in HCV infection.\n      IMPORTANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has created a global health crisis, and despite new effective antivirals, it is still a leading cause of liver disease and death worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that innate immunity may be a potential therapeutic target for HCV, but it may also be a correlate of increased disease. Due to a lack of access to human tissues with acute HCV infection, in this study we evaluated the role of innate immunity in resolving infection with a hepacivirus, GBV-B, in common marmosets. Collectively, our data suggest that NK cell and DC mobilization in acute hepacivirus infection can dampen virus replication but also regulate acute and chronic liver damage.

The greatest microbiota shift was observed after antibiotic treatment. The bacterial community composition at 2 weeks post-FMT resembled the pre-FMT community structure, although differences in the abundances of minor bacterial populations remained.

We assessed the longitudinal impact of daily treatment with the VSL#3 probiotic on cellular and humoral immunity and inflammation in healthy macaques.

In addition, the functional outcomes of HLA-B*57:01 N-glycan disruption/modulation on KIR3DL1ζ+ Jurkat reporter cells and primary human KIR3DL1+ NK cells was assessed. Different glycosylation enzyme inhibitors had varying effects on HLA-B*57:01 expression and KIR3DL1-Fc binding.

This effect was paralleled by decreased activation of KIR3DL1ζ+ Jurkat reporter cells, as well as increased degranulation of primary human KIR3DL1+ NK cell clones when encountering HLA-B*57:01-expressing 721.221 cells that were pre-treated with tunicamycin.

It is unclear whether this activation is due to LPS, residual viral replication, or both. Few studies have addressed the effects of persistent in vivo levels of LPS on specific immune functions in humans in the absence of chronic viral infection or pathological settings such as sepsis. We previously reported on a cohort of HIV-negative men with subclinical endotoxemia linked to alterations in CD4/CD8 T cell ratio and plasma cytokine levels. This HIV-negative cohort allowed us to assess cellular immune functions in the context of different subclinical plasma LPS levels ex vivo without confounding viral effects. By comparing two samples of differing plasma LPS levels from each individual, we now show that subclinical levels of plasma LPS in vivo significantly alter T cell proliferative capacity, monocyte cytokine release, and HLA-DR expression, and induce TLR cross-tolerance by decreased phosphorylation of MAPK pathway components. Using this human in vivo model of subclinical endotoxemia, we furthermore show that plasma LPS leads to constitutive activation of STAT1 through autocrine cytokine signaling, suggesting that subclinical endotoxemia in healthy individuals might lead to significant changes in immune function that have thus far not been appreciated.\n","tags":null,"title":"Naturally Occurring Subclinical Endotoxemia in Humans Alters Adaptive and Innate Immune Functions through Reduced MAPK and Increased STAT1 Phosphorylation.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henrich","Hanhauser","Harrison","Palmer","Romero-Tejeda","Stephanie Jost","Bosch","Kuritzkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"36794e41ed98dafb951c23eaacc0436e","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/26512140/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/26512140/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted a case-controlled study of the associations of CCR5-Δ32 heterozygosity with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reservoir size, lymphocyte activation, and CCR5 expression in 114 CCR5(Δ32/WT) and 177 wild-type CCR5 AIDS Clinical Trials Group participants receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy.

Here we investigated the effects of lentivirus infection on natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, phenotypes, and functions in naive and acutely or chronically SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques. Compared to that in naive animals, we observed a 3-fold-greater frequency of cytotoxic CD16(+) CD56(-) NK cells in LN of chronically infected macaques. However, NK cells did not appear to be trafficking to LN, as homing markers CD62L and CCR7 did not increase on circulating NK cells during infection. LN NK cells demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in acute infection, with 2-fold increases in perforin expression and 3-fold increases in CD107a expression following mitogen stimulation. Lysis of K562 cells by LN NK cells from acutely infected animals was greater than lysis by preinfection samples from the same animals. LN NK cells from chronically infected animals lysed K562 cells more efficiently than LN NK cells from uninfected animals, but importantly, surrogate markers of cytotoxicity in infected macaques were disproportionately greater than ex vivo killing. Furthermore, Tim-3, an indicator of activation and/or exhaustion, was upregulated 3-fold on LN NK cells in chronically infected animals. Collectively, these data suggest that LN NK cells are skewed toward a cytotoxic phenotype during SIV infection but may become dysfunctional and exhausted in chronic disease.\n      IMPORTANCE: The accumulation of CD16(+) CD56(-) NK cells in the SIV-infected lymph node without changes in NK homing to the LN could suggest that these cells are differentiating in situ. Surprisingly, this increase in frequency of the cytotoxic subset of NK cells is not accompanied by an increase of similar magnitude in the cytolytic function of LN lymphocytes. This functional modulation, together with the higher Tim-3 expression observed on LN NK cells isolated from chronically infected animals than on those from naive macaques, is indicative of an exhausted phenotype. This exhaustion could contribute to the robust replication of HIV and SIV in the LN during acute and chronic stages of infection, allowing the survival of infected cells and maintenance of a viral reservoir.\n","tags":null,"title":"Accumulation of Cytotoxic CD16+ NK Cells in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Lymph Nodes Associated with In Situ Differentiation and Functional Anergy.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Billingsley","Rajakumar","Connole","Salisch","Adnan","Kuzmichev","Hong","Keith Reeves","Kang","Li","Li","Haase","Johnson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"5ee22c4c8dfcd6b433999d9e668dbf45","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/25768938/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/25768938/","section":"publication","summary":"The onset of protective immunity against pathogenic SIV challenge in SIVΔnef-vaccinated macaques is delayed for 15-20 weeks, a process that is related to qualitative changes in CD8+ T cell responses induced by SIVΔnef.

Unsupervised clustering of expression profiles organized naïve and memory CD8+ T cells into groups concordant with cell surface phenotype. Transcription factor expression patterns in SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals were distinct from those observed in purified CD8+ T cell subsets obtained from naïve animals, and were intermediate to expression profiles of purified central memory and effector memory T cells. Expression of transcription factors elicited by SIVΔnef vaccination also varied over time: cells obtained at later time points, temporally associated with greater protection, appeared more central-memory like than cells obtained at earlier time points, which appeared more effector memory-like. Expression of transcription factors associated with effector differentiation, such as ID2 and RUNX3, were decreased over time, while expression of transcription factors associated with quiescence or memory differentiation, such as TCF7, BCOR and EOMES, increased. CD8+ T cells specific for a more conserved epitope expressed higher levels of TBX21 and BATF, and appeared more effector-like than cells specific for an escaped epitope, consistent with continued activation by replicating vaccine virus. These data suggest transcription factor expression profiling is a novel method that can provide additional data complementary to the analysis of memory cell differentiation based on classical phenotypic markers.

We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape.

These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), distinguishable by high expression of NKp44 and RORγt, play key roles in mucosal defense and homeostasis, but are depleted from gastrointestinal (GI) tract large bowel during chronic SIV infection. However, less is known about the kinetics of ILC loss, or if it occurs systemically. In acute SIV infection, we found a massive, up to 8-fold, loss of NKp44+ILCs in all mucosae as early as day 6 post-infection, which was sustained through chronic disease. Interestingly, no loss of ILCs was observed in mucosa-draining lymph nodes. In contrast, classical NK cells were not depleted either from gut or draining lymph nodes. Both ILCs and NK cells exhibited significantly increased levels of apoptosis as measured by increased Annexin-V expression, but while classical NK cells also showed increased proliferation, ILCs did not. Interestingly, ILCs, which are normally noncytolytic, dramatically upregulated cytotoxic functions in acute and chronic infection and acquired a polyfunctional phenotype secreting IFN-γ, MIP1-β, and TNF-α, but decreased production of the prototypical cytokine, IL-17. Classical NK cells had less dramatic functional change, but upregulated perforin expression and increased cytotoxic potential. Finally, we show that numerical and functional loss of ILCs was due to increased apoptosis and ROR γt suppression induced by inflammatory cytokines in the gut milieu. Herein we demonstrate the first evidence for acute, systemic, and permanent loss of mucosal ILCs during SIV infection associated with reduction of IL-17. The massive reduction of ILCs involves apoptosis without compensatory de novo development/proliferation, but the full mechanism of depletion and the impact of functional change so early in infection remain unclear.\n","tags":null,"title":"Hypercytotoxicity and rapid loss of NKp44+ innate lymphoid cells during acute SIV infection.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cordelia Manickam","Keith Reeves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"f0c17b66472669c1c0b2e346a6df8e30","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/25538700/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/25538700/","section":"publication","summary":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a global public health burden costing billions of dollars in health care annually.

This local Ab production and delivery system correlated spatially and temporally with the maturation of local protection against high-dose pathogenic SIV vaginal challenge. Thus, designing vaccines to elicit production and concentration of Abs at mucosal frontlines could aid in the development of an effective vaccine to protect women against HIV-1.\n","tags":null,"title":"Live simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine correlate of protection: local antibody production and concentration on the path of virus entry.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shang","S.

In this article, we report a systematic study of NK cell responses to high-dose vaginal exposure to SIVmac251 in the rhesus macaque female reproductive tract (FRT). Small numbers of NK cells were recruited into the FRT mucosa following vaginal inoculation. The influx of mucosal NK cells preceded local virus replication and peaked at 1 wk and, thus, was in an appropriate time frame to control an expanding population of infected cells at the portal of entry. However, NK cells were greatly outnumbered by recruited target cells that fuel local virus expansion and were spatially dissociated from SIV RNA+ cells at the major site of expansion of infected founder populations in the transition zone and adjoining endocervix. The number of NK cells in the FRT mucosa decreased rapidly in the second week, while the number of SIV RNA+ cells in the FRT reached its peak. Mucosal NK cells produced IFN-γ and MIP-1α/CCL3 but lacked several markers of activation and cytotoxicity, and this was correlated with inoculum-induced upregulation of the inhibitory ligand HLA-E and downregulation of the activating receptor CD122/IL-2Rβ. Examination of SIVΔnef-vaccinated monkeys suggested that recruitment of NK cells to the genital mucosa was not involved in vaccine-induced protection from vaginal challenge.

Chronic progressive HIV-1 infection has been associated with a loss of CD4(+) T helper cell function and with the accumulation of anergic NK cells. As several studies have suggested that cytokines produced by CD4(+) T cells are required to enhance NK cell function in various infection models, we hypothesized that reconstitution of HIV-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses by therapeutic immunization would restore NK cell activity in infected individuals. Using flow cytometry, we examined the function of CD4(+) T cells and NK cells in response to HIV-1 in subjects with treated chronic HIV-1 infection before and after immunization with an adjuvanted HIV-1 Gp120/NefTat subunit protein vaccine candidate provided by GlaxoSmithKline. Vaccination induced an increased expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by Gp120-specific CD4(+) T cells in response to HIV-1 peptides ex vivo, which was associated with enhanced production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) by NK cells. Our data show that reconstitution of HIV-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell function by therapeutic immunization can enhance NK cell activity in HIV-1-infected individuals.\n      IMPORTANCE: NK cells are effector cells of the innate immune system and are important in the control of viral infection. Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role played by NK cells in controlling and/or limiting acquisition of HIV-1 infection. However, NK cell function is impaired during progressive HIV-1 infection. We recently showed that therapeutic immunization of treated HIV-1-infected individuals reconstituted strong T-cell responses, measured notably by their production of IL-2, a cytokine that can activate NK cells. The current study suggests that reconstitution of T-cell function by therapeutic vaccination can enhance NK cell activity in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between adaptive and innate immune mechanisms involved in HIV-1 immunity and unveil opportunities to harness NK cell function in future therapeutic vaccine strategies to target HIV-1.\n","tags":null,"title":"CD4+ T-cell help enhances NK cell function following therapeutic HIV-1 vaccination.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sasikala-Appukuttan","Kim","Kinzel","Hong","S.

The distribution and densities of the tetramer+ cells at the portal of entry did not correlate with the maturation of protection or change after challenge. Given these findings, we discuss the possibility that changes in other aspects of the immune system, including the quality of the resident population of virus-specific effector CD8 T cells could contribute to maturation of protection, as well as the potential for vaccine strategies that further increase the size and quality of this effector population to prevent HIV-1 transmission.\n","tags":null,"title":"Location and dynamics of the immunodominant CD8 T cell response to SIVΔnef immunization and SIVmac251 vaginal challenge.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carville","Evans","Keith Reeves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1383264000,"objectID":"f56ed694f35dff6f6a2b6b1c3b313063","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/24244365/","publishdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/24244365/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite extensive use of nonhuman primates as models for infectious diseases and reproductive biology, imprecise phenotypic and functional definitions exist for natural killer (NK) cells.

However, the response of NK cells to monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection is not well characterized. In this intravenous challenge study of MPXV infection in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), we analyzed blood and lymph node NK cell changes in absolute cell numbers, cell proliferation, chemokine receptor expression, and cellular functions. Our results showed that the absolute number of total NK cells in the blood increased in response to MPXV infection at a magnitude of 23-fold, manifested by increases in CD56+, CD16+, CD16-CD56- double negative, and CD16+CD56+ double positive NK cell subsets. Similarly, the frequency and NK cell numbers in the lymph nodes also largely increased with the total NK cell number increasing 46.1-fold. NK cells both in the blood and lymph nodes massively proliferated in response to MPXV infection as measured by Ki67 expression. Chemokine receptor analysis revealed reduced expression of CXCR3, CCR7, and CCR6 on NK cells at early time points (days 2 and 4 after virus inoculation), followed by an increased expression of CXCR3 and CCR5 at later time points (days 7-8) of infection. In addition, MPXV infection impaired NK cell degranulation and ablated secretion of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Our data suggest a dynamic model by which NK cells respond to MPXV infection of rhesus macaques. Upon virus infection, NK cells proliferated robustly, resulting in massive increases in NK cell numbers. However, the migrating capacity of NK cells to tissues at early time points might be reduced, and the functions of cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion were largely compromised.

Furthermore, previous pDC studies have been complicated by incomplete descriptions of generalized depletion during HIV/SIV infection, and the effects of infection on pDCs outside peripheral blood remain unclear. In scheduled-sacrifice studies of naive and chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques we evaluated the distribution and functionality of pDCs in multiple tissues using surface and intracellular polychromatic flow cytometry. As previously observed, pDCs were reduced in peripheral blood and spleens, but were also depleted in non-lymphoid organs such as the liver. Interestingly, pDCs accumulated up to fourfold in jejunum, colon and gut-draining lymph nodes, but not in peripheral lymph nodes. Most unexpectedly, SIV infection induced a multi-functional interferon-α, tumour necrosis factor-α, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β cytokine secretion phenotype, whereas in normal animals these were generally distinct and separate functions. Herein we show a systemic redistribution of pDCs to gut tissues and gut-draining lymph nodes during chronic SIV infection, coupled to a novel multi-functional cytokine-producing phenotype. While pDC accumulation in the mucosa could aid in virus control, over-production of cytokines from these cells could also contribute to the increased immune activation in the gut mucosa commonly associated with progressive lentivirus infections.\n","tags":null,"title":"Multi-functional plasmacytoid dendritic cells redistribute to gut tissues during simian immunodeficiency virus infection.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Evans","Keith Reeves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1375315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1375315200,"objectID":"95dea8d58929cb88146a16294aade97b","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/23966557/","publishdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/23966557/","section":"publication","summary":"Tissue-directed trafficking of dendritic cells (DCs) as natural adjuvants and/or direct vaccine carriers is highly attractive for the next generation of vaccines and immunotherapeutics.

Furthermore, because the normal flora of the oral cavity is vast and significantly diverse, host immunity must balance a complex system of tolerance and pathogen recognition. Due to the rapid recognition and response to pathogens, the innate immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells, likely plays a critical role in mediating this balance. Because logistical and ethical restraints limit access to significant quantities of human mucosal tissues, non-human primate models offer one of the best opportunities to study mucosal NK cells. In this study we have identified both classical NK cells, as well as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in tonsillar and buccal tissues and oral-draining lymph nodes. Identified by mutually exclusive expression of NKG2A and NKp44, NK cells, and ILCs in the oral mucosa are generally phenotypically and functionally analogous to their gut counterparts. NKG2A(+) NK cells were more cytotoxic while NKp44(+) ILCs produced copious amounts of IL-17 and TNF-α. However, in contrast to gut, oral NK cells and ILCs both produced large quantities of IFN-γ and the beta-chemokine, MIP-1β. Also in contrast to what we have previously found in gut tissues of SIV-infected macaques, we found no reduction in NK cells during chronic SIV infection, but rather an expansion of ILCs in oral-draining lymph nodes and tonsils. These data suggest that the lentivirus-induced depletion of the NK cell/ILC compartment in the gut may be absent in the oral mucosa, but the inherent differences and SIV-induced alterations are likely to have significant impact on preventing oral opportunistic infections in lentiviral disease.

In the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies, Env-specific antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) emerged by three weeks after inoculation with SIVΔnef, increased progressively over time, and was proportional to SIVΔnef replication. Persistent infection with SIVΔnef elicited significantly higher ADCC titers than immunization with a non-persistent SIV strain that is limited to a single cycle of infection. ADCC titers were higher against viruses matched to the vaccine strain in Env, but were measurable against viruses expressing heterologous Env proteins.

In contrast to HIV-1, we found that soluble SIVmac239 gp140 retains the ability to form stable oligomers without the necessity for introducing additional, stabilizing modifications.

Soluble gp120 and gp140 bound to SIV-specific immortalized B cells, and to SIV Env-specific B lymphocytes in peripheral blood of immunized animals.

Mamu-A1*00201 tetramers folded with certain SIV peptides, but not others, directly stained primary NK cells and Jurkat cells expressing multiple allotypes of Mamu-KIR3DL05.

To explore the antigenic threshold for the maintenance of PD-1 expression on virus-specific T cells, we compared PD-1 expression on virus-specific and memory T cell populations in controlled and uncontrolled SIV and HIV-1 infection. In both controlled live attenuated SIV infection in rhesus macaques and HIV-1 infection in elite controllers, elevated levels of PD-1 expression were observed on SIV- and HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells. However, in contrast to chronic wild-type SIV infection and uncontrolled HIV-1 infection, controlled SIV/HIV-1 infection did not result in increased expression of PD-1 on total memory T cells. PD-1 expression on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells rapidly decreased after the emergence of CTL escape in cognate epitopes, but was maintained in the setting of low or undetectable levels of plasma viremia in live attenuated SIV-infected macaques. After inoculation of naive macaques with a single-cycle SIV, PD-1 expression on SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells initially increased, but was rapidly downregulated.

NK cell cytolysis can be induced directly through diverse receptor families or can be induced indirectly through Fc receptors by antibodies mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC has been implicated in both protection from simian immunodeficiency virus infection and slower progression of HIV-1 disease. ADCC activity declines with advancing infection, and yet the underlying mechanism for this dysfunction has not been defined, nor has it been determined whether the activity can be reconstituted. Here we demonstrate that NK cell-mediated ADCC is severely compromised in chronic HIV infection. The potency of ADCC function was directly correlated with baseline Fc gammaRIIIa receptor (CD16) expression on NK cells. CD16 expression was negatively influenced by elevated expression of a group of enzymes, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), normally involved in tissue/receptor remodeling. Inhibition of MMPs resulted in increased CD16 expression and augmented ADCC activity in response to antibody-coated target cells. These data suggest that MMP inhibitors may improve NK cell-mediated ADCC, which may provide subjects with an opportunity to harness the cytolytic power of NK cells through naturally occurring nonneutralizing HIV-specific antibodies.\n","tags":null,"title":"Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors restore impaired NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Turelli","Liagre-Quazzola","Mangeat","Verp","Stephanie Jost","Trono"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1207008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1207008000,"objectID":"860a0d1ee57e9775a9141c38676349eb","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/18434399/","publishdate":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/18434399/","section":"publication","summary":"Interferon (IFN) has been part of the standard treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection for more than 2 decades, yet the mechanism of action of this antiviral remains poorly understood.

Because the simian immunodeficiency virus-macaque model closely mimics human immunodeficiency virus disease in humans, with both infections inducing a decrease in pDCs, we characterized and compared pDCs in the BM with those in peripheral blood (PB) of healthy pig-tailed macaques. The results revealed that pDCs from both compartments had the same CD123++ HLA-DR+ Lin- phenotype and were similar in size. Although BM-derived pDCs (BM-pDCs) were 3-fold greater in frequency and 10-fold greater in number, they had lower cell surface expression of both HLA-DR and the costimulatory molecule CD86 than did PB-pDCs. Both BM- and PB-pDCs responded ex vivo to synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and inactivated influenza virus by upregulating HLA-DR and CD86 and secreting cytokines; however, stimulated BM-pDCs secreted less alpha interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha per cell than did PB-pDCs. These results suggest that while BM-pDCs appear to be phenotypically less mature than PB-pDCs, they do respond to pathogens. Thus, during acute infections, these cells could initiate immune responses either in the BM or after rapidly migrating from the BM into the periphery. A better characterization of pDCs in blood and tissues will be beneficial for future studies of macaques that focus on either pathogenesis or vaccine development.\n","tags":null,"title":"Characterization of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in bone marrow of pig-tailed macaques.\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Williams","Keith Reeves","Kariuki","Cox"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1188604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1188604800,"objectID":"3b6eb269e24c993569a3afc4919c83c4","permalink":"https://reeveslab.github.io/publication/17912386/","publishdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/17912386/","section":"publication","summary":"In the presence of NaBH(OAc)(3), a 1,5-keto-aldehyde, contained within a side-chain of an eta(4)-dienetricarbonyliron complex, undergoes a double reductive amination sequence with a series of primary amines, to provide the corresponding piperidine products in good to excellent yield.
